# Phase 1: Core Infrastructure & Authentication - Work Report

## Date: June 30, 2025
## Author: Claude

## Summary
Completed Phase 1 MVP implementation focusing on Core Infrastructure & Authentication as specified in the PM brief. All three tasks have been completed successfully.

## Completed Tasks

### Task 1.1: Initialize Supabase Project ✅
- Created Supabase initialization script at `/scripts/init-supabase.sh`
- Created Phase 1 database schema migration at `/apps/server/supabase/migrations/phase1_auth_schema.sql`
- Schema includes:
  - Organizations table with subscription management
  - Profiles table extending auth.users
  - Row Level Security policies
  - Automatic profile/organization creation on signup

### Task 1.2: Implement Database Schema ✅
- Phase 1 schema focuses only on authentication requirements
- Implemented organizations table with:
  - Unique slug generation
  - Subscription tier tracking (starter, growth, enterprise)
  - Subscription status (trialing, active, past_due, canceled)
- Implemented profiles table with:
  - Organization association
  - Role-based access (owner, admin, member)
  - Full integration with Supabase auth

### Task 1.3: Implement Authentication System ✅
Created comprehensive authentication system including:

#### Authentication Service
- Enhanced existing `SupabaseAuthService` at `/packages/core/src/services/supabase-auth-service.ts`
- Full TypeScript support with Zod validation schemas
- Methods for signup, signin, signout, password reset, profile updates

#### Authentication Pages
- **Sign Up Page** (`/apps/web/app/auth/signup/page.tsx`)
  - Collects first name, last name, email, password, organization name
  - Form validation with error handling
  - Redirects to email verification page
  
- **Sign In Page** (`/apps/web/app/auth/signin/page.tsx`)
  - Email/password authentication
  - Remember me functionality
  - Forgot password link
  
- **Password Reset** (`/apps/web/app/auth/reset-password/page.tsx`)
  - Email-based password reset flow
  - Success confirmation UI
  
- **New Password** (`/apps/web/app/auth/new-password/page.tsx`)
  - Password update form with confirmation
  - Validation for password strength
  
- **Email Verification** (`/apps/web/app/auth/verify-email/page.tsx`)
  - Instructions for email verification
  - Clean UI with next steps

#### User Profile Page
- Created profile page at `/apps/web/app/profile/page.tsx`
- Displays authenticated user data:
  - Avatar with initials fallback
  - Full name and email
  - Role and organization info
  - Account creation date
- Sign out functionality

#### Middleware & Protection
- Utilized existing authentication infrastructure
- `withAuth` HOC for route protection
- `useAuthContext` hook for accessing auth state
- Automatic session management and refresh

## Integration Points

### Frontend Integration
- Authentication pages integrated with existing UI components
- Consistent styling using the design system
- Proper error handling and loading states
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

### Backend Integration
- Authentication routes already exist at `/apps/server/src/routes/auth.ts`
- OpenAPI documentation included
- Rate limiting configured
- Validation middleware in place

## Security Considerations
- Passwords validated for minimum length and complexity
- Email verification required for new accounts
- Secure session management with refresh tokens
- Row Level Security enforced at database level
- HTTPS-only cookie settings for production

## Next Steps
With Phase 1 complete, the system is ready for:
1. Phase 2: Integration Hub development
2. Phase 3: Analytics Engine implementation
3. Phase 4: Insights & Optimization features

## Dependencies
- Supabase local instance must be running
- Environment variables configured:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
  - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

## Testing Instructions
1. Run `./scripts/init-supabase.sh` to initialize local Supabase
2. Navigate to `/auth/signup` to create a new account
3. Check email (Inbucket at http://localhost:54324) for verification
4. Sign in at `/auth/signin`
5. View profile at `/profile`

## Notes
- Docker must be running for local Supabase
- Email testing available via Inbucket during development
- Production deployment will require proper SMTP configuration
